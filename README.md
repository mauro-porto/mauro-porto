  <summary> <b> Things to know about me! </b> <i>(click to expand!)</i> </summary>
  Outgoing, proactive and creative are characteristics that define me. Having positivity helps me to make the best decisions and stay calm when programming and creating a new layout for a screen. As a hobby, I usually develop projects that stimulate my creativity and logical thinking, in addition, I love play soccer, watching videos about technologies and discussions about financial!
